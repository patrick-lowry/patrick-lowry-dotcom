To achieve that, we must add a new dimension to our samples - a process called feature transformation. Beyond that the approach is the same as above - we can use the formula :\n\n$\n\n### Determining the weights\n\nA quadratic relationship between $x$ and $y$ line has the form: $y = ax^2 +bx + c$ . This formula now has 3 unknowns $a,b,c$ which need to be determined - these are the parameters of the model. To achieve this, where we only have 1 feature for each x, we must add a new feature - a process called 'feature transformation'. With this added feature, we can use the **same formula** as for the linear case to determine the parameters.\n\nOur exrta feature will just be the square of $x$ - so we now have $(x, x^2)$ for each observation. We use this to construct a *design matrix* \\(X\\) and also add a '1' as a first feature - this allows us to capture the constant $c$.\n\n$\nX =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & x_1 & x_1^2 \\\\\n1 & x_2 & x_2^2 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n1 & x_n & x_n^2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$\n\nUsing this design matrix, the weights (ie parameters ie {a,b,c}$ are still computed using the same equation as above:\n\n$\nW = (X^\\top X)^{-1} X^\\top y\n$\n\nThe resulting weights vector from which we can extract the parameters of the quadrtic is:\n\n$\nW =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nc \\\\\nb \\\\\na\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$\n\nwhich we can then use to reconstruct the curve using the quadratic equation:\n\n$\ny = ax^2 + bx + c\n$\n\n\n# REGRESSION WHERE THE RELATIONSHIP IS CUBIC\n\n### Plot a cubic (polynomial of order 3)\n\n### For a cubic function the relationship is of the form:\n\n$y = ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + d$ \n\nWe do exactly the same as for quadratic - we just add another feature, this time $x^3$ and use the same formula to determine the values of $a,b,c,d$.\n\n# ALTERNATIVE USING RBF\n\n### Radial Basis Function (RBF) feature transformation\n\nPolynomial features work well for smooth global trends, but they are less\nflexible when the relationship changes locally.\n\nAn alternative approach is to transform each input using **radial basis\nfunctions (RBFs)**.\n\nAn RBF is centred at a point μ and measures how close x is to that centre:\n\n$$\n\\phi(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\n\nEach RBF produces a local feature that is strongest near its centre and\ndecays smoothly with distance.\n\nBy placing several RBFs across the input range, we can represent complex\nnon-linear relationships while still using the same linear regression\nformula:\n\n$$\nW = (X^\\top X)^{-1} X^\\top y\n$$\n\nAs before, only the **feature representation** changes — not the method\nused to determine the weights.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"01-regression.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
